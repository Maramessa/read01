## Welcome to GitHub Pages
## What is Markdown?
When you add bold, italics, numbered lists, bullet points, headings, and so on to text, you’re “formatting” it. Markdown is a syntax—or, set of rules—that formats text on web pages.
Headers
# #This is an H1

## ##This is an H2



Bullet Points
* Red
* Green
* Blue

Numbered Lists
1. Bird
2. McHale
3. Parish

Emphasis
*bold*
_italics_

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Maramessa/read01/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Maramessa/read01/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
